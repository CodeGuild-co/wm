					<h1>Computer Science and Software Engineering</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The course is split into two broad areas; computer science, and software engineering</p>
					<p>For each session we'll split the room into two groups, one half will do a computer science session, the other a software engineering one</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Hi! I'm William Mayor, call me Billy</p>
					<p>I'm a Software Engineer, I mostly build websites</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>I'm running the software engineering side of the course</p>
					<p>Software engineering is the discipline and art of creating software</p>
					<p>I'm going to take you through the things that I think make for good software engineering</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Hi! I'm Paul Cook</p>
					<p>Billy wrote this presentation and he doesn't know what I do. Something to do with chips?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>I'm running the computer science side of the course</p>
					<p>Computer science is the science of computing</p>
					<p>I'm going to show you just how smart computers are</p>
				</section>

						<h2>The Challenge</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>There's a project element to this course, something that you will be working on throughout the week as individuals and in teams</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>A big part of a Software Engineer's CV is a record of work</p>
						<p>Employers really like it if they can see evidence that you know what you're doing</p>
						<p>A popular way to provide this evidence is through a blog</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Developers write about lots of things:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Thoughts on software engineering</li>
							<li>Solutions to problems they encountered</li>
							<li>Languages and frameworks that they're using</li>
							<li>Fun things, personal things, anything!</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The communication skills you learn by writing a blog are also really good things to have on your CV</p>
						<p>Being to communicate complicated topics well is a fantastic ability that employers will absolutely love</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>It's not just about employment though, writing a blog makes you part of a huge community of technical people who share ideas and learn new things</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The challenge this week is to build your own blog and to start to write posts about computer science and software engineering</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Each session that we do this week should teach you something new</p>
						<p>After the session you should distil the things you've learned into a blog post</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>You might want to write posts that explain the topic you've just learned to others</p>
						<p>You might want to write a memo to yourself so you can come back in the future</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>You might want to disagree with the contents of the session</p>
						<p>You might write up a scathing review</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>It's up to you</p>
						<p>The goal is that you start this pattern of learning something and writing about it</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>In order to make things interesting we're going to get into 6 groups</p>
						<p>Each group will take a programming language and a web framework that they'll use to create their individual blogs</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>You'll work as a team to learn and explore your language and framework</p>
						<p>You'll work individuall writing up blog posts on your own blog</p>
						<p>At the end of the week, you'll present back to the room the things you've learned</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The whole room is then going to vote for the language and framework that they think looks the best</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Split into Teams</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>If you guys already know one of the programming languages that we've picked you might want to be in that group</p>
						<p>Or you might want to branch out and learn something new</p>
						<p>It's up to you.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Here are the teams:</p>
						<h3>Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP, Java, Static HTML</h3>
