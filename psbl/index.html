					<h1>Problem Solving and Being Lazy</h1>
					<h3>The fundamentals of Software Engineering (IMO)</h3>

						<h2>Before We Start...</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>You're going to be writing blog posts</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>So let's write our first one</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Activity</h3>
						<p>Write a blog post about what you want to get out of this course</p>

				<section>
					<p>Software engineering, in my opinion, boils down to two things:</p>
					<h3>Solving problems and being lazy</h3>
					<p>If you can do these things, you can engineer software</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Problem Solving</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The art of breaking a task down into small, single-focus problems, then solving those problems whilst being aware of the whole.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Let's take an example</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim>
Write a script that calculates the
nth number in the Fibonacci sequence

e.g.
> fibonacci(6)
8
> fibonacci(10)
55
						</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>What are the problems here?</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Here's my list:</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>What's the Fibonacci sequence?</li>
							<li>How do I calculate numbers in the sequence?</li>
							<li>Who's asking?</li>
							<li>What's a script?</li>
							<li>How can we write one?</li>
							<li>What platform are we on?</li>
							<li>What language do we pick?</li>
							<li>Who's going to use the script?</li>
							<li>What do I need to install?</li>
							<li>What do I need to deliver?</li>
							<li>How fast does this need to be?</li>
							<li>How far into the sequence should I be prepared to go?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Problems are often "meta problems", problems you have to solve in order to solve other problems</p>
						<p>e.g. What's the Fibonacci sequence?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Some problems are specific to you the individual</p>
						<p>e.g. What text editor should I use?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Some are shared problems between developers</p>
						<p>e.g. What language should we use?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Some problems are specific to the project</p>
						<p>e.g. How do I calculate numbers in the sequence?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>I think this kind of method of problem solving; breaking things down into smaller chunks, is quite natural. I think most people do it all the time, how could you get any suitably large task done otherwise?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>In software engineering you tend to need to be more explicit about what these tasks are, you need to write them down and describe them.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>This is because you want to be able to stop working on the project and come back to it tomorrow.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>You want to be able to share the project workload with other people.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>You want to be able to easily tell what you're doing, why you're doing it, and in what context you're doing it.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>You want to know how well you're doing, and how much more work is required before you finish.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>That's problem solving...</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Being Lazy</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The second part of software engineering is being lazy</p>
						<p>This means doing the smallest amount of work possible in order to solve the problem</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>Don't write code if someone else has already written it</li>
							<li>Don't spend time making the code better and faster if you don't have to</li>
							<li>DRY: Don't repeat yourself</li>
							<li>KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Being lazy doesn't mean doing work badly</p>
						<p>Don't cut corners, don't rush stuff, don't leave work for other people to do</p>
						<p>It means, how can you most easily do an excellent job</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Being lazy doesn't mean shooting yourself in the foot</p>
						<p>There are lots of problems to solve for any given task, the laziest solution to one problem might mean lots of work further down the line</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>In fact being lazy might involve putting in hours of work now in order to save weeks of work later</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>That's it!</h2>
					<h3>That's all the wisdom I have for you</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Activity</h3>
					<p>Write a blog post about problem solving and being lazy</p>
					<p>Remember, it's your blog, write what you like:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Explain things to other people</li>
						<li>Jot down notes for your future self</li>
						<li>disagree with the ideas and write a rebuttal</li>
					</ul>
